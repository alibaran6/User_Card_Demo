This project was originally developed by me, aiming to create a user-friendly program for students at Iztech to record and manage their grades efficiently.  

Special thanks to CurrentechLabs for their assistance with the graphical components of the program, and to Daniel Gakwaya for the knowledge I gained from his courses on Udemy.
