# User_Card_Demo

This project provides students at İzmir Institute of Technology (IZTECH) with a user-friendly interface to record their own or their friends’ academic information and automatically generate a personalized student card.

Instead of manually uploading their GPA, users can enter their individual course grades according to their study program. The application then calculates their GPA and total acquired credits.

The program also offers several useful features:

Sorting students within the same program or across all programs

Estimating possible GPA changes based on hypothetical grade updates

Tracking grade history and progress

Saving and loading student data in the .ctl file format

With these functionalities, students can easily analyze their academic performance, monitor their progress, and compare their standing among other students.
